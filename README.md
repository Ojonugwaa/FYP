 Bridging the Skill Gap Between University and Industry

This project uses deep learning to help students align their university-acquired skills with industry-required skills by analyzing CVs, job descriptions, and university curricula.

Project Overview

The goal of this system is to provide students with personalized feedback on what industry-relevant skills they possess and what skills they still need to acquireâ€”based on their CV and a target job description. The system also recommends resources (courses, tutorials) and highlights relevant university courses.



 Core Features

1. Skill Extraction Model
- BERT-based NER model trained on annotated CV and job description data.
- Extracts job titles and technical skills from uploaded CVs and job descriptions.
- Identifies missing skills based on user input and job requirements.

 2.  Course Recommendation System
- Recommends relevant Coursera and Udemy courses (from static datasets).
- Matches missing skills with appropriate learning resources.
- Works without relying on live API access.

 3.  Curriculum Grouping System
- Analyzes BSc Computer Science and Management Information Systems curricula (Covenant University).
- Groups university courses by relevant job titles.
- Students can search for a job and see related university courses.

 4. Job-Skill Relevance Mapping
- Matches extracted skills to university-taught topics.
- Highlights gaps between education and job market needs.

5.  Upcoming Features
- Trending Skill Detection: Mine job postings for emerging skill trends.
- Personalized Learning Paths: Recommend dynamic learning plans based on current and desired skills.



Technologies Used

- Backend: FastAPI, Pydantic
- NLP: BERT-based NER (Hugging Face Transformers)

- Data Processing: Pandas, Excel
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

 


 How It Helps

- Helps students prepare for the job market before graduation.
- Empowers universities to see which parts of their curriculum map to in-demand jobs.
- Promotes self-directed learning based on real industry expectations.



Future Work

- Add dashboards for job trends and curriculum coverage.
- Integrate LinkedIn job data for richer skill tracking.
- Enable real-time course updates via APIs once stable network access is available.
